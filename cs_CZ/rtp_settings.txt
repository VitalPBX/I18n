rtp_settings.ice_host_candidates.tooltip =
	When Asterisk is behind a static one-to-one NAT and ICE is in use, ICE will expose the server's internal IP address
	as one of the host candidates. Although using STUN (see the 'stunaddr' configuration option) will provide a
	publicly accessible IP, the internal IP will still be sent to the remote peer. To help hide the topology of your internal
	network, you can override the host candidates that Asterisk will send to the remote peer. If you do define anything
	here, you almost certainly will NOT want to specify the 'Stun Server' or 'Turn Server' addresses.
