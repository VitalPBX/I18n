cdr_settings.size.tooltip =
    It defines the maximum number of CDRs to accumulate in the buffer before posting them to the database engine.
cdr_settings.time = Max Batch Time
cdr_settings.time.tooltip =
    The maximum time in seconds to accumulate CDRs in the buffer before posting them to the database engine.
    If this time limit is reached, then it will post the records, regardless of the value defined for '{cdr_settings.size}'.
cdr_settings.batch = Batch Mode
cdr_settings.batch.tooltip =
    Setting this parameter to "Yes" will enable the batch mode for the CDR. When this parameter is enabled, instead of
    posting the CDR at the end of every call, the data will be stored in a buffer to help alleviate the load on the
    asterisk server.<br><br>
    <b>WARNING:</b> The use of the batch mode may result in data loss after unsafe asterisk termination
    (i.e. software crash, power failure, kill -9, etc.)
