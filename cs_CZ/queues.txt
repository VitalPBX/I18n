menu.queues = Queues
module.queues = Queues
queues = Queues
queues.announcement_id = Agent Announcement
queues.announcement_id.tooltip = An announcement may be specified which is played to the agent as soon as they answer a call, typically to indicate to them which queue this call should be answered as, so that agents or members who are listening to more than one queue can differentiated how they should engage the customer.
queues.announce_frequency = Announce Frequency
queues.announce_frequency.placeholder = Value in seconds
queues.announce_frequency.tooltip = Defines how often we should announce the caller's position and/or estimated hold time in the queue. Set this value to zero to disable. In a small call center, it is unlikely that the system will be able to make accurate estimates, and thus callers are more likely to find this information frustrating.

queues.announce_position.no = No
queues.announce_position.no.tooltip = The position will never be announced
queues.announce_position.tooltip = Defines whether the caller's position in the queue should be announced to her. If you have any logic in your system that can promote callers in rank (i.e., high-priority calls get moved to the front of the queue), it is best not to use this option. Very few things upset a caller more than hearing that theyâ€™ve been moved toward the back of the line.
queues.announce_position.yes = Yes
queues.announce_position.yes.tooltip = The caller's position will always be announced
queues.announce_position_limit = Announce Position Limit

queues.autofill = Autofill
queues.autofill.tooltip = The old behavior of the queue (autofill=no) is to have a serial type behavior in that the queue will make all waiting callers wait in the queue even if there is more than one available member ready to take calls until the head caller is connected with the member they were trying to get to.
queues.autopause = Autopause
queues.autopause.all = All
queues.autopause.no = No
queues.autopause.tooltip = Enables/disables the automatic pausing of members who fail to answer a call. Select "All" to mark this member as paused in all queues. This parameter can be tricky in a live environment, because if the agent doesn't know they've been paused, you could end up with agents waiting for calls, not knowing they've been paused. Never use this unless you have a way to indicate to the members that they've been paused, or have a supervisor who is watching the status of the queue in real time.
queues.autopause.yes = Yes

queues.queue_timeout.tooltip =
    It represents the absolute amount of time to allow a caller to stay in the queue before the caller is removed from the queue.

queues.timeoutrestart = Timeout Restart
queues.timeoutrestart.tooltip = If set to yes, resets the timeout for an agent to answer if either a BUSY or CONGESTION status is received from the channel. This can be useful if the agent is allowed to reject or cancel a call.
