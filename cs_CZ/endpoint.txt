Type in a target network segment and mask, such as 192.168.0.0./24, and click on Scan Subnet for Devices. The discovery will take some time, depending on the number of addresses that can potentially exist on the subnet. Be careful not to use a mask that is too big, as this will impact the time required to complete the discovery process. If devices cannot be discovered by scanning the network, you can manually enter the MAC address of any phones that you want to manage. After completing a scan, you will need to define additional parameters for each phone: <br><ul><li>Brand from the drop-down list of known brands</li><li>Model from the drop-down list of models that are factory-defined</li><li>Template that this phone should use</li><li>Devices that should be linked to this phone.

Note that the IP address used by phones that reside on the same network as the PBX may be different from the address used by phones that are outside the local network. Phones that are on the same network can use the physical address of the PBX, even if it is a private IP address. Phones that are outside the network will need to use a publicly-accessible IP address or hostname.
epm.host_settings.sip_port = SIP Port
epm.host_settings.sip_port.tooltip = SIP port, typically 5060, is the port that IP phones will access when using SIP protocol. Phones that are on the same network as your PBX typically use the default port, while phones that are outside the local network may utilize port-forwarding to use a different port. There is no default value if this field is left blank: if you do not type a value for this field, SIP phones will not work.
epm.host_settings.iax_port = IAX2 Port
epm.host_settings.iax_port.tooltip = IAX2 Port, typically 4569, is the port that IP phones will access when using IAX2 protocol. Phones that are on the same network as your PBX typically use the default port, while phones that are outside the local network may utilize port-forwarding to use a different port. There is no default value if this field is left blank: if you do not type a value for this field, IAX2 phones will not work.
epm.host_settings.http_port = HTTP Port
epm.host_settings.http_port.tooltip = HTTP Port, typically 80, is the port that IP phones will use for HTTP access. Phones that are on the same network as your PBX typically use the default port, while phones that are outside the local network may utilize port-forwarding to use a different port. There is no default value if this field is left blank.
epm.host_settings.https_port = HTTPS Port
epm.host_settings.https_port.tooltip = HTTPS Port, typically 443, is the port that IP phones will use for HTTPS access. Phones that are on the same network as your PBX typically use the default port, while phones that are outside the local network may utilize port-forwarding to use a different port.

epm.template.admin_password.tooltip = This is the password that can be used by users to manually access the configuration interface of IP phones based on this template. You should be aware of limitations imposed by your IP Phone. For example, some IP phones will only accept the password as numeric digits. The Endpoint Manager does not validate whether the password will be acceptable by the phone: you must refer to the manufacturer's documentation for your specific phone.
