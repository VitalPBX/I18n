pjsip_settings.mwi_disable_initial_unsolicited.tooltip = 
	When the initial unsolicited MWI notification are enabled on startup then the initial notifications get sent at
	startup. If you have a lot of endpoints (thousands) that use unsolicited MWI then you may want to consider
	disabling the initial startup notifications. When the initial unsolicited MWI notifications are disabled on startup
	then the notifications will start on the endpoint's next contact update.
